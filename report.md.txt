Impact of different data balancing techniques in the random forest classification accuracy of the adult data set.

Abstract:
The adult data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). Has been around since 1994, and has been used as a classification problem, linking different data (i.e Education) to income level. If we use this dataset to classify income level (i.e. over or under 50k), the data will be Highly unbalanced, giving around 90% accuracy just by classifying everyone under 50K. 

In this paper, I assessed the effect that different data balancing techniques have in the default random forest classification using 300 estimators.
In order to isolate the real effect of the different balancing techniques, I did a basic data preprocessing and used the confusion matrix to monitor the impact of the balancing techniques in the model.

Random Forest method was selected over SVM, KNN, and Neuroteworks, as it gave the better initial classification (trying when possible to use default values of scikit learn).

Introduction:
This paper is a hectic attempt to show my understanding of the basic process to build, calibrate and evaluate a model for machine learning over a specific dataset. (under 10 hours of work).
The first version, (delivered on time) will show the basic preprocessing of the data, the run of the models over that data and the effects that different class balancing approaches on the training data have on the overall accuracy of the models.
I will attempt to deliver a version 2 or even a 3 if I have the time after my other courses and my year’s close at work, and I see that I can significantly improve my grade.
The evaluation of the models in the first version is done using the confusion matrix, particularly focussing on reducing the number of False Negatives (i.e. records that the model wrongly shows as not making more than 50k), due to time pressure, no cross-validation nor hyperparameter optimization will be performed in this first version.
The adult data set has been precleaned of null values and its data quality is good enough to allow me to isolate the effects of data balancing.

Research:
Please refear to model_v2.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook).
This code is in github at https://github.com/juanflorezVe/PML_A2/blob/master/model_v2.ipynb

The dataset:
The data set has 15 columns, in order to increase my speed, and remove personal bias, I renamed the column from ‘a’ to ‘o’, and chose ‘o’ 
The one that shows either <=50k or > 50k. as the class.
